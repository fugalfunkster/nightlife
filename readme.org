* Nightlife App

** ToDo List [2/6]
- [X] Signup for Yelp API keys
- [X] Hash out user permissions
- [ ] views
- [ ] routes
- [ ] controllers
- [ ] model - implement data expiration

** Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://whatsgoinontonight.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku. [1/8]
- [ ] As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
- [ ] As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
- [ ] As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
- [ ] As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
   
** Design Ideas
*** use ajax except for auth
*** mongo permits data expiration: 
**** https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/expire-data/ 
*** automatically generate list of bars? from ip? geolocate?
*** store location in session?
*** YELP
**** https://www.yelp.com/developers/manage_api_keys
**** QUERY: https://api.yelp.com/v2/search/?location=97267&limit=10&category_filter=bars
**** {businesses[{name, url, image_url, id, is_closed}]}
**** npm install : https://github.com/olalonde/node-yelp



** User Permissions
- only authenticated users can rsvp
